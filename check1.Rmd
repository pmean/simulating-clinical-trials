Here's a basic example given at https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started

```{r basic-example, include=FALSE}
library(rstan)
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
schools_dat <- list(J = 8, 
                    y = c(28,  8, -3,  7, -1,  1, 18, 12),
                    sigma = c(15, 10, 16, 11,  9, 11, 10, 18))

fit <- stan(file = '8schools.stan', data = schools_dat, 
            iter = 1000, chains = 4)
save(fit, file="school.RData")
```
